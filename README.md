# image-rename-util

Overview
--------

This is a simple application designed to assist with renaming large groups of images using a standard naming convention. This application takes a configuration file that contains the file naming conventions that you wish to use. If the filename contains a * , then that filename will be incremented on each use and the * will be replaced with the count of the current image. Renamed files are copied into the selected outputs directory.
